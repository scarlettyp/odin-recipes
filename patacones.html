	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>This Ecuadorian appetizer is a common part of every meal. Its attractiveness and desirable taste comes from its simplicity.</p>

	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>2 green plantains</li>
		<li>Oil for frying</li>
		<li>Salt</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Peel the plantains, the easiest way to peel a green plantain is to make the lengthwise cut on one of the angles, the cut should be skin deep without touching the actual flesh of the plantain, then use the knife to raise the skin and peel it off.</li>
		<li>Cut the plantains into thick slices, you can make straight cuts or slightly diagonal cuts.</li>
		<li>Heat the oil over medium high heat in a frying pan â€“ use enough oil to almost cover the plantain slices - or a deep fryer, temperature should be about 350 F, fry the plantains until they start to get yellow, but not golden.</li>
		<li>Remove the plantains and place on paper towels to drain the oil.</li>
		<li>Use the bottom of a glass (or small bowl or a wood pestle) to smash and flatten the plantains, do this gently to keep the slices from breaking, a few cracks is ok as long as the whole slice remains in one piece. It is best to do this when they are still warm.</li>
		<li>Sprinkle the plantain slices with salt and other seasonings (if using the raw garlic rub it on the slices).</li>
		<li>Reheat the oil, temperature should be about 375 F and fry the plantains until golden on each side, about 1-2 minutes per side.</li>
		<li>Remove from the oil, drain again on paper towels, and add additional seasoning if needed.</li>
		<li>Serve warm as a side dish or as an appetizer with dipping sauces.</li>
